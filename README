Traffic Management Application (Wish GPS)

Overview
--------
This project implements a client-server traffic management application using sockets, pthreads, and SQLite3 in C. It allows clients to manage and interact with a database of roads, track locations, and dynamically insert new roads into the database.

Components
----------
1. Server:
   - Handles multiple client connections concurrently using threads.
   - Stores road information persistently in an SQLite3 database (trafic.db).
   - Manages road details such as neighbors, intersections, distances, gas stations, crashes, and weather conditions.

2. Client:
   - Connects to the server to send commands and receive responses.
   - Provides an interactive interface for querying locations or inserting new road information.

Features
--------
- Multithreaded server to handle simultaneous client connections.
- SQLite3 database for persistent storage of road data.
- Automatic generation of road attributes including distance, speed limit, and intersections.
- Dynamic insertion and neighbor assignment for roads.
- Basic command interface supporting operations such as inserting roads and locating positions.

Technologies Used
-----------------
- C Programming Language
- POSIX Sockets
- Multithreading (pthreads)
- SQLite3 Database
- Compatible with Linux/macOS operating systems

Prerequisites
-------------
Before compiling, ensure the following packages are installed:

- SQLite3 development libraries:
  sudo apt-get install libsqlite3-dev

- GCC Compiler:
  sudo apt-get install build-essential

Compilation Instructions
------------------------
Compile the server:
  gcc server.c -o server -lpthread -lsqlite3

Compile the client:
  gcc client.c -o client -lpthread

Usage Instructions
------------------
Start the Server:
  ./server

Start the Client:
  ./client <server_ip> 2728

Example:
  ./client 127.0.0.1 2728

Client Commands
---------------
- Locate current position on a road:
  locatie <road_name>

- Insert a new road into the database:
  insert_drum <road_name> <road_type>

  Available road types:
  - autostrada
  - drum
  - oras

- Exit the application:
  exit

Database Structure
------------------
